Players' performance coaches, fitness trainers, physiotherapists, doctors, and dietitians can also access the program alongside them to offer advice on how to get better so they can perform better during games.​
Business Requirements

NBA fitness and health database management system requires understanding the specific needs and objectives of the league, its teams, and the athletes. Identify key entities and attributes related to this use case to gather the actual datasets / create sample datasets with adequate size to cover the business problem/need defined above. Also, draw relationships amongst identified entities and attributes and arrive at a database model/design iteratively for the logical data models. Besides, you need to design queries using an application to determine the decision variables. Further, you need to perform SQL connectivity in Python and perform analysis related to the database model.

Athlete Profiles and Health Records: Create individual athlete profiles containing comprehensive health records, injury history, fitness assessments, medical exams, and performance data.
Injury Tracking and Rehabilitation Plans: Track injuries, rehabilitation progress, and recovery plans for players.
